Advanced Systems Format (formerly Advanced Streaming Format, 
Active Streaming Format) is Microsoft's proprietary digital 
audio/video container format, especially meant for streaming 
media. ASF is part of the Windows Media framework. ASF media 
files generally have file extensions of .asf or .wmv. 

Code here is a parser implementation of ASF media file. The 
lower level of the parser is to load ASF file, identify all 
head objects, and read ASF data packets. The higher level of 
the parser is to make SDP for the media and pack ASF data 
packets into RTP packets, which are required for RTSP based 
media streaming system.
